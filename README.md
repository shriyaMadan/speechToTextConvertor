# speechToTextConvertor
This will convert your speech in textual form.
This is built using javascript. It uses speechRecognition API. 

You can copy the text once it is converted. 

Also just for fun, I have added few automated replies:
Try asking about "the weather today" or just question about "how are you?" and wait for the response xD
