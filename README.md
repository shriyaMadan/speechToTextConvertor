# speechToTextConvertor
This will convert your speech in textual form.
This is built using javascript. It uses speechRecognition API. 

It may ask permission to turn your device's microphone on. Click *Allow* in such case.
You can copy the text once it is converted. 

Also just for fun, I have added few automated replies:
Try asking about "the weather today" or just question about "how are you?" and wait for the response xD

PS: This was made by me a year ago, just for the purpose of practicing JS.
